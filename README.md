# Using Robo Advisor To Get Investment Portfolio Recommendations For Retirement.

Combine your new AWS skills with your existing Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

# Instructions

This section is divided into the following three steps:

- Configure the initial robo advisor
- Build and test the robo advisor
- Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function

# Final Submission/Uploads
- A Python script with final Lambda function.
- Two short videos or animated GIFs that demo your robo advisor in action from the “Test bot” pane as requested.
